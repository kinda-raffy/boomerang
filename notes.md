In terms of collecting information, I feel like it is best to subdivide ecommerce into sub-categories. These categories will have seperate means of collecting information and reachong out to the user. For example in general garments, we might not collect user intention at all, but heavily rely on item properties to create out prompt.


Information collection:

- Collect item information.
  - Item properties and charecteristics.
  - Price and quality.
  - Tone and audience -> store

  - Item information is useful in contexts where buying intention does not make sense. For example, in general clothing, users will buy because they like the style and a question like what is your intention will just confuse them. For this case, we can jsut rely on the item properties, which will tell us the specific style the user likes (comforatbale, sporty, light colours).

- Collect location information (any specific events (sporting events, local holidays, weather)
- Collect buying intention (user prompted)... think about how this should be generated.
- Collect user information (age, gender)

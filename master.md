# Boomerang

Boomerang is a tool focused on retaining existing customers.

More specifically, Boomerang relies on super peronalised messages to create genuine connections.
To do this, customers will be redireced to a Boomerang form just before or after a purchase. This
allows us to understand the context behind every purchase, and the questions on the form will be
auto-generated based on the product on hand.

Boomerang may also pull data in from a business backend, which might include account information,
location or a product description.

At the consumer 'drop-off' date, Boomerang will send a highly personalised message to the customer.
For example, if someone orders candles for a special event, after a month Boomerang will generate
prompts highly related to that event (in a very positive under-tone).

Importantly, Boomerang is able to weave in promotional prompts into the message itself, which brands
may utilse to promote special events.

Besides genaration, Boomerang's data collection allows for an invaluable marketing viewpoint 
through its comprehensive dashboard, which provides specific insights into their current market 
condition. (Aggregated customer dropoff, motivations, etc.)
